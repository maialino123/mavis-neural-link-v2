# Proposal: English Learning Mode for Mavis Neural Link

## Problem Statement
The user (Boss) wants to improve English skills while browsing, but finding/translating/learning vocabulary manually is slow and breaks the flow (context-switching).

## Proposed Solution
Integrate an "English Learning Mode" into the browser extension that:
1. Captures selected text or text under hover.
2. Provides instant "Liquid Glass" tooltips with:
   - Meaning (Vietnamese).
   - Contextual usage (Example sentences).
   - Audio pronunciation (TTS).
3. Stores learned words into a "Daily Flashcard" list for later review.

## Success Criteria
- User can hover/select a word and get a translation in <500ms.
- UI follows "Liquid Glass" design (Refraction, Blur, Saturation).
- Integration with OpenClaw backend for persistent memory.

## User Persona
Founder/Dev (Level: Learning English, Focus: Tech & Survival Vocabulary).
